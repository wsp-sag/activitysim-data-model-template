# activitysim-data-model-template
A template for creating data models for travel models generally and ActivitySim-based travel models specifically.

## Work in Progress
This is an initial demonstration of what a data model could be in the ActivitySim context. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for how to get started with GitHub templates.
